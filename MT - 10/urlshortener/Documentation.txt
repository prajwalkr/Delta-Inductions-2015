My URL shortener app will generate a *unique* shortened url for each entered URL
How is this made possible?

I have a text file say, 'prev_id.txt' which stores a whole number in base 10 called 'id'. This digit is crucial to generate a shortened URL or to regenerate the lengthened URL from the shortened URL.

For creating the shortened URL, we have the following:

a 'charmap' containing : "abc....zABC...Z012345...9"

And we also have id to the base 62.

Hence, for every id in base 10, we have a unique base 62 number and each digit of the base62 number can correspond to a unique character in charmap.

Hence, say we have id=63, then its base62 is '11'
Hence a unique sequence of characters can be generated corresponding to '11' using the charmap, which gives '11' ---> 'aa'

Then we update the id in the "prev_id.txt" to id+1
Hence when the next url is shortened, we will have id=64, hence the sequence of characters will be 'ba'.

To retrieve back the original url from the shortened one, we get the sequence of characters, say 'ba'.
From the 'charmap' we get 'ba' corresponds to '21', from that, 2*(62^0) + 1*(62^1) = 64 = the id of the url.
We query for the url using the 'id' in the database and return it!

Simple innit? :P
