1. First of all, WEB-DEV is super-cool, I think. I was totally new to this and Abhishek, thanks a lot for helping me out!
2. The best thing about doing all these tasks, as far as I am concerned, is that with every task I learned new stuff. 
3. I learnt the basics of web dev, I knew nothing. 
4. I got the best intro to Django. Thanks for taking me one step at a time.
5. I learned how a bit about how to "DEVELOP". The most important thing.  

On the whole I really liked the diversity of the tasks that were given to me. And I loved the flexibility and the approchability of Delta. :D
