So, after goin to chrome://version
I get:
JavaScript	V8 4.3.61.23

Now for the omnibox( chrome://omnibox/ ):
After typing my name and clicking submit:
	It gives search results from various sources, sorted in the descending order
	of relevance. The Internet search result (from google.co.in) has the highest
	relevance. Next are from the history. 
	The relevance of the history results are probably decided based on the 		frequency of visiting that particular link.
